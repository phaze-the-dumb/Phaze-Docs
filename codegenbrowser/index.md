3) Click the next button on the side of the screen

4) Wait for the file to finish computing (This may take a while)

**Note: On Version `0.1.0` you will need to click the browser tab on the sidebar again as it doesn't load the first time**

5) If at any point during this process it stops working dm `Phaze#6193` and ask me about it as I cannot be bothered to write debugging documentation right now

6) Enjoy browsing codegen
